  <p>The Elder Scrolls</p>  
 <p><b>The Elder Scrolls </b>  
 are artifacts of unknown origin and quantity, being simultaneously archives of historic, past and future events. They often tell of events that require a Hero to resolve them, although the Scrolls themselves do not select such individuals.[1] They are also known as the "Aedric Prophecies," suggesting that they may have been created by the Aedra, although this designation may be inaccurate.[2] Without technological aid, Elder Scrolls cannot be read without extreme side-effects, among which are blindness[3][4] and insanity.[5]</p>

<p>The Elder Scrolls are said to "exceed both Aedra and Daedra,"[6] implying that neither group of deities created them.

Until the events each Scroll describes comes to pass, they contain information about possible events in the future, with each viewing containing a possible version of events.[7] Once a prophecy contained in an Elder Scroll is enacted in Tamriel, the text of the parchment becomes fixed. After that time, all readers ingest the same divine message, creating a historical document declaring the unequivocal truth of a past event. The contents of a scroll, once solidified, cannot be altered by any known magic.[2]

The Scrolls have some relation to time, and offer a view through a fixed point in time to the flow to time itself.[7] However, they appear to be dependent on the flow of time in order to function; events which alter the linearity of time, known as Dragon Breaks, cannot be recorded or predicted by the Elder Scrolls.[8]

Paarthurnax explains that dragons are uniquely vulnerable to the effects of the Elder Scrolls, being born of Akatosh, the god of time. This would explain how Alduin was cast into the future and how a Time Wound was formed at the point of his banishment.[9]</p>
